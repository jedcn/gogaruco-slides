  - name: "Josh Susser"
    bio: "<p>Josh likes to say that Ruby is the love child of Lisp and Smalltalk, raised by Perl the eccentric nanny. At Pivotal Labs he spent the last several years developing Rails web applications for clients, and he is a high-ranked contributor to the Rails open source project. He has spoken at RailsConf, regional conferences and meetups.</p><p>In past lives he's done Smalltalk VM implementation, spent too much time at Apple building the ill-fated OpenDoc, and helped design the Java VM that runs on the SIM card in your iPhone.
